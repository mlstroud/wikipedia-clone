                    <p>Aries is the ninth studio album by Mexican recording artist Luis Miguel (pictured). Released by WEA Latina in 1993, it features pop ballads and dance numbers with R&B influences. "Ayer" and "Hasta Que Me Olvides", two of the album's three singles released for sale, topped the US Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart. "Hasta el Fin" and "Tú y Yo" were released as promotional singles, both peaking at number four on that chart. Aries stayed at number one on the US Billboard Latin Pop Albums for 19 weeks. It sold over one million copies in Mexico, and over two million copies worldwide through 2000. Upon its release, the album received mixed reviews from music critics; they were divided on the dance tunes and ballads, although Miguel's vocals and the album's arrangements garnered positive reactions. The Aries Tour promoted the record in Latin America and the United States. Miguel received several accolades for the album, including the Grammy Award for Best Latin Pop Album. (Full article...)</p>
